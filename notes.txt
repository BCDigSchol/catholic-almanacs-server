persID and persName cannot start with a hyphen (-)? (not even a hyphen)

year (e.g., Detroit 1866, Erie 1867)

special characters encoding?

paginator (difference?? is it parseInt?)

for components: parent/child structure?

(page)="changePage($event)" event binding?

filter by a year range (how to change the back end?)

should I have two separate pages for institutions and people?
should I have a separate page (or section) for find by instID?
