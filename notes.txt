persID and persName cannot start with a hyphen (-)? (not even a hyphen)

year (e.g., Detroit 1866, Erie 1867)

special characters encoding? (Lamy)

paginator (difference?? is it parseInt?)

(page)="changePage($event)" event binding? (click attending inst, click "back" -- need to refresh the page)

should I have two separate pages for institutions and people? -- also, should I display people in the institution page
should I have a separate page (or section) for find by instID?

better mobility for filter bars

what if a church's name changed (e.g. alt.il.0007) filter: instYear = 1864 (mat-card); inst-detail name - 1870

the space between columns appears different on different pages

querying person with a page number is slower than expected


improvements to be made:
1. tables (personInYear unnecessary)
2. improve controllers (an additional field of all the relevant people to an institution, attending institions and attended institutions)
