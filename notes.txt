persID and persName cannot start with a hyphen (-)? (not even a hyphen)

year (e.g., Detroit 1866, Erie 1867)

special characters encoding? (Lamy)

paginator (difference?? is it parseInt?)

for components: parent/child structure?

(page)="changePage($event)" event binding? (click attending inst, click "back" -- need to refresh the page)

filter by a year range (how to change the backend?)

should I have two separate pages for institutions and people? -- also, should I display people in the institution page
should I have a separate page (or section) for find by instID?

better mobility for filter bars

name: the latest name of an institution (not necessarily 1870 for those that didn't exist in 1870)

tables of inst details (in different years) -- child component?

child component select years (@output)

what if a church's name changed (e.g. alt.il.0007) filter: instYear = 1864 (mat-card); inst-detail name - 1870
